Metadata Examples
=================

Below, the contents of a fully functioning example metadata file are shown,
which contains metadata for several example datasets. This file is included
with each installation of **neurotic** and is loaded automatically when
**neurotic** first starts.

With this metadata file loaded in **neurotic**, you may use the "Download data"
feature to fetch the data files and run the examples, and you may try the "Edit
metadata" feature to test modifications (remember to "Reload metadata" after
saving changes).
