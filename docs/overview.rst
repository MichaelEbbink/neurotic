Overview
========

To use **neurotic**, first organize your datasets in a *metadata file* like
this (see :ref:`config-metadata`):

.. code-block:: yaml

    my favorite dataset:
        description: This time it actually worked!

        data_dir:           C:\local_dir_containing_files
        remote_data_dir:    http://myserver/remote_dir_containing_downloadable_files  # optional
        data_file:          data.axgx
        video_file:         video.mp4
        # etc

        video_offset: -3.4  # seconds between start of video and data acq
        epoch_encoder_possible_labels:
            - label01
            - label02
        plots:
            - channel: I2
              ylim: [-30, 30]
            - channel: RN
              ylim: [-60, 60]
            # etc

        filters:  # used only if fast loading is off (lazy=False)
            - channel: Force
              lowpass: 50
            # etc
        amplitude_discriminators:  # used only if fast loading is off (lazy=False)
            - name: B3 neuron
              channel: BN2
              units: uV
              amplitude: [50, 100]
            # etc

    another dataset:
        # etc

Open your metadata file in **neurotic** and choose a dataset. If the data and
video files aren't already on your local computer, the app can download them
for you, even from a password-protected server. Finally, click launch and the
app will use a standard viewer layout to display your data to you using
ephyviewer_.

researcher very happy.)*

The viewers are easy and intuitive to navigate (see `User Interface`_):

- Pressing the play button will scroll through your data and video in real
  time, or at a higher or lower rate if the speed parameter is changed.
- The arrow/WASD keys allow you to step through time in variable increments.
- Jump to a time by clicking on an event in the event list or a table entry in
  the epoch encoder.
- To show more or less time at once, right-click and drag right or left to
  contract or expand time.
- Scroll the mouse wheel in the trace viewer or video viewer to zoom.
- The epoch encoder can be used to block out periods of time during which
  something interesting is happening for later review or further analysis
  (saved to a CSV file).
- All panels can be hidden, undocked, stacked, or repositioned on the fly.

Electrophysiologists will find this tool useful even if they don't need the
video synchronization feature!

**Portability is easy with neurotic!** Use relative paths in your metadata file
along with a remotely accessible data store such as GIN_ to make your metadata
file fully portable. The same metadata file can be copied to a different
computer, and downloaded files will automatically be saved to the right place.
Data stores can be password protected and **neurotic** will prompt you for a
user name and password. This makes it easy to share the **neurotic** experience
with your colleagues! ðŸ¤ª
